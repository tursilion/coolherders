Cool Herders animation speeds:

SHEEP: Every 4 frames
HERDER: Every 4 frames
Background A: 6 frames
Background A Toy Factory: 10 frames
Background B: 10 frames
Background B Disco: 6 frames
Background C: 15 frames

BUG? Waterworks has two different speeds for A and B (6 and 10), both probably should be 6.
