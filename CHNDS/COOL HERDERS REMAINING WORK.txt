NETWORK
-------
-Networking may not be 100% stable - in particular network errors may pop up twice in a row in some cases
-Network play is slow

-speed may be helped -- we sync twice during the frame now... maybe a third one?
The problem before was syncing during the player process loop, so different players could see different inputs.

FINALIZATION
------------
