To rebuild the banner:

Edit the text strings in coolherders.bsf
This is a UTF-16 file, so use something like TextPad.  Make sure that BOM (Byte Order Marker) is ON, 
and file is little endian

Place a 32x32x16 color graphic in coolherders.bmp

Assuming that the NitroSDK tools are in your path, type:
ntexconv coolherders.bmp -no -bg -bgb -bgnc
makebanner coolherders.bsf
