/Just an archive of undocumented behaviour ;)
--------------------------------------------

Cheats that unlock or change behaviour do not trigger autosaves. However, you can manually save (or trigger an autosave normally) to save the changes to VMU.

Anywhere:
*Hold A+B+X+Y+Start to return to title page. If on Title Page, exits to main menu. You must release at least X and Y on the title page for at least 1/2 second before pressing it again to quit the game. (Tursi 1/feb/06)
*There is a JPG photo of Tursi's (messy) dev station in the Bonus folder on the disc (Tursi 21 Mar 06)
*Not deliberate, but too hard to work around - start a game (story mode or multiplayer), then soft-reset back to the menu. This will still increment the games played counter towards bonuses. (Tursi 21 Mar 06)

Main Menu:
*Hold left trigger while moving down to select 'demo' - which just runs a computer-only game like in the normal demo mode (Tursi 21 Mar 06)

Player Select:
*Hold either trigger to select alternate character on signpost - characters must be unlocked first so this may not be TOO secret. ;) (Tursi 4/Mar/06)

Level Select:
*Tap up 7 times from main selection to get Heaven (Tursi 1/Feb/06)
*Tap down 6 times from main selection to get Hell (Tursi 21 Mar 06)

Single Player:
*Hold either trigger during story mode to get alternate AYB text (New Zealand only)
*Have a second player hold triggers on non-player controls when the player presses A or Start at end of story mode text. That controller will then control the computer player (must do every level). (Tursi 17/Feb/06)
*Press Start instead of A to skip story-mode text (Tursi 4/Mar/06)

Bonus Screen:
*Hold right trigger to speed up the bonus counting (Tursi 4/Mar/06)
*Hold left trigger to slow down the bonus counting (Tursi 4/Mar/06)

Image Gallery:
*Press either trigger for a random image (Tursi 4/Mar/06)

Music Gallery:
*Press either trigger for a random tune (Tursi 4/Mar/06)

End Credits:
*Hold right trigger to speed up the scroll and icons (Tursi 4/Mar/06)
*Hold left trigger to slow down the scroll and stop icons from changing (Tursi 4/Mar/06)
*Hold both triggers for rapid scrolling and icon changing (Tursi 4/Mar/06)
*Press Y to stop background movement (this is displayed onscreen) (Tursi 4/Mar/06)
*Press A to re-start background movement (this is displayed onscreen) (Tursi 4/Mar/06)
*Press X+DPAD Right (not analog) to speed up background movement (Tursi 4/Mar/06)
*Press X+DPAD Left (not analog) to slow down background movement (Tursi 4/Mar/06)

Options Menu:
*Hold left trigger on highest controller port to see build date (Tursi 4/Mar/06)
*Hold right trigger on highest controller port to see number of games played (Tursi 4/Mar/06)

InGame:
*Leave paused several minutes for a 'screensaver' mode where the screen darkens and the score boxes bounce around (Tursi 4/Mar/06)

Paused:
*Triggers control brightness in night mode (if you use this and then save, even due to another autosave, it will remember the new brightness. However, changing it won't in itself trigger an autosave.)  (Tursi 4/Mar/06)

Continue Screen:
*UUDDLRLR to add a continue (Tursi - 13/01/06)

Cheat codes (enter at title screen, or various other places, but 'Start' must be at title screen):
*AAAAAAAAAA - if you make a mistake, tapping A 10 times will clear it
*ARRAY Start - All worlds (normal mode, again for hard mode. Hard mode not needed for multiplayer.)
*BLURB Start - All players
*LUXURY Start - Enable 'disable powerups' menu option
*AYBAYB Start - Enable alternate text in story mode (not saved)
*BALLAD Start - Unlock music gallery
*RADAR Start - Unlock ghost sheep control
*BULLY Start - Unlock image gallery
*RURALLY Start - Unlock night mode
*DURABLY Start - Unlock end credits
*BABY Start - Always win Story Mode
*BABYBABY Start - Never fail challenges
*YABAX Start - Unlock Omake mode
*YABBA Start - Only play story text (no game, just view story)

If you enter a code for a feature that's already unlocked, the screen will just flash to black and return to menu.

Tactics
-------
-Be aggressive. very aggressive.
-Avoid head-on firefights. Snipe opponents from the side or back and circle around to get their sheep.
-In points based matches, fire rapidly and grab all the crates and powerups you can
-Stretch out points and sheep based matches to improve your odds by sniping the other herders from time to time and keeping a pool of wild sheep
-In the Disco challenge - sit still until the dancers approach your hiding place. Make them start to destroy the disco balls then sneak out the back way and run for it!
