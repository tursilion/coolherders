With apologies, while GOAT Games is still selling the original code, this is a source-only reference release.

Currently the original game remains available for purchase at [https://www.goatstore.com/shop/sega/dreamcast/dreamcast-developments/cool-herders/](https://www.goatstore.com/shop/sega/dreamcast/dreamcast-developments/cool-herders/)

It's 2022, and Cool Herders for the Dreamcast is /not/ public domain, /not/ freeware, /not/ abandonware. I am still right here and it's still for sale. :)
