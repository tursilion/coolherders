This is a collection of all the Cool Herders releases to date. It's important to note that there's a lot of incomplete and unfinished work in here. It's also important to note that I am sharing this code only for the sake of education and curiousity.

NO PERMISSION IS GRANTED TO CREATE DERIVED WORKS FROM THIS CODE.

Sorry, I'm not done with it!

That said, besides the odd random tool, this is what you will find here:

Atari 2600 Version - this is very incomplete. You can run around a maze and a sheep moves with you. It was created with the Batari BASIC compiler, and my intent was to make a simple 4k 1vs1 game. Someday I may complete it. Available above in the dist folder.

Game Boy Advance ROM - this is just a promotional slideshow with some music. The GBA release became the NDS release. Available above in the dist folder.

Dreamcast version - this was the first release, however, it's still available, so only the raw source is provided here. You can purchase the game [from GOAT Store for $14.90 - it is NOT abandonware](https://www.goatstore.com/shop/sega/dreamcast/dreamcast-developments/cool-herders/). You can also [download a demo version here](https://harmlesslion.com/zips/CoolHerders_DJ.zip). You will need to be able to write DiscJuggler images to burn it.

Nintendo DS Version - this was never released officially, though it got close. The source (excluding binary data and proprietary source files) is above. You can [download the 90% ROM here](https://harmlesslion.com/zips/CoolHerdersBeta_90Percent.rar). It includes some documentation and runs both on hardware (if you have a way to load it) and most emulation. As of Feb 2022, DraStic remains the only one I've tried that correctly renders the background, all the others have an off-by-one that leaves cracks. (See the source code for the single line proof).

XNA Version - this didn't get very far, and I don't know if it's even possible to run it anymore. But it's a good curiousity. Source only. This code is largely by Keith Henrickson and assigned to HarmlessLion.
